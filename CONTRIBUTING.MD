Thanks for your interest in contributing to sexe! This is a fun toy project that I have used to better familirize my self with Rust. I believe there is a gap in learning resources for Rust between tiny progams (single file) and mid size projects (ten files). Sexe was built as a way to learn about writing small progams in Rust as a bridge to larger programs. I hope you will be able to get the same benefit out of it that I did!

As this is just a toy project, code quality is not critically important, although I do want to keep some level of code quality in the project. Do not be afraid to make a pull request even if it is your first time writing Rust or you are unsure about your code. I am happy to comment on PRs and provide feedback to make sure everything is fine!
